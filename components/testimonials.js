                In 2019 Dr. Assumptah Turyasiimwa with the assistance of Dr.
                Therese Eyermann carried out research on Policy and Education of
                the Girl-child in Uganda. Although Assumptah was not a stranger
                to the obstacles hindering education of the girl child in
                Uganda, the study revealed that there are unique obstacles which
                tend to be ignored but continue to hinder performance, growth
                and empowerment when women have successfully graduated from
                school. As a result Assumptah teamed up with a group of ladies
                some of whom were born and raised in Africa and others who were
                born and raised United states Hence the birth of GWEE to address
                obstacles to girls and women education and empowerment WHAT IS
                OUR APPROACH GWEE recognizes that a challenge is best handled
                where it's impact is mostly felt. That is why we operate in
                schools. GWEE also understands that even after school some
                obstacles which are rooted in culture, tradition, beliefs, and
                poverty continue to impact women. That is why partner with other
                organizations that promote women empowerment GWEE started
                operating in Uganda, GWEE shall soon start operations in Ghana
                and spread to other countries.
