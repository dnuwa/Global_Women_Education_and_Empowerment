                  WHY WAS GWEE CREATED?
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2019 Dr. Assumptah Turyasiimwa with the assistance of Dr.
                  Therese Eyermann carried out research on Policy and Education
                  of the Girl-child in Uganda. Although Assumptah was not a
                  stranger to the obstacles hindering education of the girl
                  child in Uganda, the study revealed that there are unique
                  obstacles which tend to be ignored but continue to hinder
                  performance, growth and empowerment when women have
                  successfully graduated from school. As a result Assumptah
                  teamed up with a group of ladies some of whom were born and
                  raised in Africa and others who were born and raised United
                  states Hence the birth of GWEE to address obstacles to girls
                  and women education and empowerment WHAT IS OUR APPROACH GWEE
                  recognizes that a challenge is best handled where it's impact
                  is mostly felt. That is why we operate in schools. GWEE also
                  understands that even after school some obstacles which are
                  rooted in culture, tradition, beliefs, and poverty continue to
                  impact women. That is why partner with other organizations
                  that promote women empowerment GWEE started operating in
                  Uganda, GWEE shall soon start operations in Ghana and spread
                  to other countries.
