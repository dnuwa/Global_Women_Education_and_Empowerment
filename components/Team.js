              passion for the education of girls and women is dated back to the
              time when she was an adolescent. Having grown up at a time when
              education of the girl-child in her society was seen as a privilege
              and a luxury reserved for a few, Assumptah started asking
              questions when she was fourteen years. At that time, some people
              in her community believed she was “ready for marriage”. Since
              then, she has been trying to find answers of how to protect, train
              and educate girls and women so that they can become independent,
              and able to make their own decisions.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-5">
              Assumptah has a doctorate in educational leadership (EdD) from
              California Lutheran University, California USA. She also has a
              master’s degree in Educational Administration and Planning (MED)
              and Bachelor’s degree with Education (BA/Educ), both, from
              Makerere University, Kampala Uganda. She also has a certificate in
              Project management (PMP). While doing her doctorate, Assumptah
              researched on the impact of policy on the education of the
              girl-child. This gave her a broad understanding of various
              strategic plans and policies in both developed and developing
              countries and the missing link to the success of the polilcies.
              This research built on her master’s thesis which analyzed how
              Universal Primary Education (UPE) impacted the education the rural
              girl child. Her research projects coupled with the 12 years’
              experience as a principal of a rural girl’s secondary school are a
              constant reminder that something needs to be done. The girl-child
              needs more than just a school in the neighborhood!!!!!This is why
              Global Women Education and Empowerment (GWEE) was founded. We are
              a team committed to finding ways and means of alleviating
              obstacles to the education of the girl-child globally Assumptah is
              also a volunteer with “Together Women Raise” a nonprofit that
              supports Girl’s education and advocates for global policies that
              promote girls and women education and welfare. She also sits on
              the United States Refugee Advisory Board (USRB), a body that
              advocates for refugees globally. During her free time Assumptah
              enjoys spending time with her family.

            <p className="mb-5">
              Assumptah was able to go through school with the help people who
              believed in her and her potential. She would therefore like to
              give back to society by supporting girls born in disadvantaged
              environments to get proper education and training for
              self-sustainability.

              empowerment in the year1989, after doing her Primary Leaving
              Examinations. With the release of the then PLE results and Mary
              appearing as the best performer in her school, members of her
              society called it “a waste of brains”, because, being a girl, she
              was considered only fit for marriage, as secondary school and
              advanced education was a preserve of boy children. This community
              mentality gave Mary the passion and zeal to prove that girls can
              also advance in education and become influential members of
              society.
